# CV Builder Component Refactoring

This directory contains the refactored CV Builder components, extracted from the original large `app/dashboard/cv-builder/page.tsx` file (1000+ lines) into smaller, maintainable components.

## Structure

```
components/cv-builder/
├── CVBuilderPage.tsx (main container - replaces original page.tsx)
├── CVBuilderHeader.tsx (header with completion progress bar)
├── CVBuilderTabs.tsx (tab navigation component)
├── CVBuildTab.tsx (build tab with upload and sections)
├── CVTemplatesTab.tsx (template selection grid)
├── CVPreviewTab.tsx (CV preview display)
├── CVOptimizeTab.tsx (AI optimize tab with job description input)
├── CVActionsPanel.tsx (save, download, upload actions)
├── CVSectionsPanel.tsx (collapsible CV editing sections)
├── CVSaveModal.tsx (save CV modal dialog)
├── CVAIImplementationModal.tsx (AI implementation modal)
├── index.ts (exports all components)
├── README.md (this file)
└── hooks/
    ├── useCVData.ts (CV data state and handlers)
    ├── useCVSave.ts (save/update functionality)
    ├── useCVAnalysis.ts (AI analysis logic)
    └── useCVCompletion.ts (completion percentage calculation)
```

## Components

### Main Component
- **CVBuilderPage**: Main orchestrator component that manages all state and renders the appropriate tab content

### UI Components
- **CVBuilderHeader**: Header with title, description, and completion progress bar
- **CVBuilderTabs**: Tab navigation (Build CV, Templates, Preview, AI Optimize)
- **CVBuildTab**: Main build interface with upload section and CV editing sections
- **CVTemplatesTab**: Template selection grid with previews
- **CVPreviewTab**: Live CV preview with selected template
- **CVOptimizeTab**: Job-specific AI optimization interface
- **CVActionsPanel**: Left sidebar with upload, template selection, and action buttons
- **CVSectionsPanel**: Collapsible CV editing sections (Personal Info, Experience, etc.)
- **CVSaveModal**: Modal for saving/updating CV with title input
- **CVAIImplementationModal**: Modal for implementing AI recommendations

### Custom Hooks
- **useCVData**: Manages CV data state, file uploads, and all CV editing operations
- **useCVSave**: Handles CV save/update functionality with Supabase
- **useCVAnalysis**: Manages AI analysis, recommendations, and implementation
- **useCVCompletion**: Calculates completion percentage and section status

## Usage

The original `app/dashboard/cv-builder/page.tsx` has been replaced with a simple wrapper:

```tsx
"use client"

import { CVBuilderPage } from "@/components/cv-builder/CVBuilderPage"

export default function CVBuilderPageWrapper() {
  return <CVBuilderPage />
}
```

## Features Preserved

All original functionality has been preserved exactly:
- ✅ File upload and AI parsing
- ✅ Template selection and preview
- ✅ Modal system for editing CV sections
- ✅ Save/update functionality with Supabase
- ✅ AI analysis and implementation features
- ✅ Tab navigation (build, templates, preview, optimize)
- ✅ PDF generation and download
- ✅ Photo upload handling
- ✅ Complex state management and event handlers
- ✅ All TypeScript types and interfaces
- ✅ All styling and className attributes
- ✅ All prop drilling and callback patterns
- ✅ All useEffect hooks and dependencies

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the application
3. **Testability**: Smaller components are easier to test
4. **Readability**: Code is more organized and easier to understand
5. **Performance**: Better code splitting and potential for optimization

## State Management

State is managed through custom hooks that encapsulate related functionality:
- CV data and editing operations → `useCVData`
- Save/update operations → `useCVSave`
- AI analysis and recommendations → `useCVAnalysis`
- Completion calculations → `useCVCompletion`

This approach maintains the same functionality while making the code more modular and maintainable.
