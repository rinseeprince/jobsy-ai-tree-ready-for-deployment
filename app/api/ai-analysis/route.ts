COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

1. ATS SCORING IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Analyze EVERY experience section for ATS optimization opportunities
   - Identify missing industry keywords across ALL experiences
   - Suggest improvements to increase keyword density and relevance
   - Ensure proper formatting and structure recommendations

2. KEYWORD TARGETING:
   - Identify missing keywords specific to each role and the target industry
   - Suggest natural integration of relevant keywords
   - Ensure keyword variety across different experience sections
   - Match keywords to the target job description if provided

3. CONTEXTUAL RELEVANCE:
   - Provide role-specific improvements for each experience
   - Ensure suggestions are relevant to the specific position and company
   - Consider career progression and skill development
   - Maintain consistency with overall professional narrative

4. VARIETY AND NON-REPETITION:
   - Use different action verbs across experiences
   - Vary sentence structures and improvement approaches
   - Ensure each experience section has unique, tailored recommendations
   - Avoid repetitive language patterns

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. ANALYZE ALL ${allExperiences.length} EXPERIENCE SECTIONS - provide recommendations for each one that needs improvement
2. For each experience, identify specific weak verbs and improvement opportunities
3. Suggest missing quantification opportunities across all experiences
4. Identify industry keywords missing from each relevant experience
5. Provide grammar and clarity improvements where needed
6. Ensure recommendations are unlimited but high-quality
7. Focus on genuine ATS score improvements
8. Maintain professional variety and engagement
