ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Count actual words in the CV content accurately
2. Find and quote EXACT grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors with EXACT corrections
3. Identify EXACT weak action verbs with EXACT sentence replacements
4. List EXACT industry keywords found and EXACT keywords missing
5. Provide EXACT text improvements, not generic advice
6. Quote actual sentences from the CV, don't make up examples
7. Be extremely specific and actionable

EXAMPLE OF GOOD ANALYSIS:
Instead of: "Use stronger verbs"
Provide: "Replace 'was responsible for managing' with 'Led and optimized' in the sentence 'I was responsible for managing a team of 5 developers' ‚Üí 'Led and optimized a team of 5 developers, increasing productivity by 25%'"

Be thorough, accurate, and provide EXACT quotes and corrections.
