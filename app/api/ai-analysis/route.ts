You are an expert CV/Resume analyst and ATS specialist. Analyze the following CV and provide EXTREMELY COMPREHENSIVE and DETAILED feedback. I want you to find EVERY POSSIBLE improvement across ALL sections.

CV CONTENT:
${cvText}

${jobDescription ? `JOB DESCRIPTION: ${jobDescription}` : ""}

INDUSTRY: ${industry}

CRITICAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. EXAMINE EVERY SINGLE SENTENCE in the professional summary and ALL work experience descriptions
2. IDENTIFY ALL weak verbs, passive voice, and non-action words throughout the ENTIRE CV
3. FIND ALL opportunities for quantification (numbers, percentages, timeframes, currency) in EVERY experience entry
4. ANALYZE ALL industry keywords that should be present vs. what's actually there
5. CHECK EVERY sentence for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors
6. LOOK FOR ALL opportunities to make statements more impactful and specific
7. Be EXHAUSTIVE - don't miss anything, analyze every word and phrase

COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
- Go through EACH work experience entry individually and find ALL issues
- Examine the professional summary word by word for improvements
- Look for weak verbs like: involved, responsible for, worked on, helped, did, made, got, was, had, used, tried, participated, assisted, supported, handled, dealt with, managed (when vague), coordinated, organized, contributed, collaborated
- Find ALL statements that lack specific metrics, numbers, percentages, timeframes, or results
- Identify ALL missing industry-specific keywords and technical terms
- Check for ALL grammar issues including: comma splices, run-on sentences, incorrect punctuation, capitalization errors, subject-verb disagreement, tense inconsistencies

EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Find AT LEAST 10-15 weak verbs if the CV has multiple experience entries
2. Identify AT LEAST 5-10 quantification opportunities across all experiences

5. Provide specific improvements for EVERY work experience description
6. Analyze the professional summary for ALL possible improvements

EXAMPLE OF COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS:
Instead of finding just 1-2 issues, find ALL issues like:
- "Responsible for managing" ‚Üí "Led and optimized"
- "Worked with clients" ‚Üí "Collaborated with 50+ enterprise clients"
- "Helped increase sales" ‚Üí "Drove 25% increase in quarterly sales revenue"
- "Managed projects" ‚Üí "Successfully delivered 15+ projects worth $2M+ in value"
- Missing keywords: "CRM", "Salesforce", "lead generation", "pipeline management", "revenue optimization", etc.

Be EXTREMELY thorough and comprehensive. Find EVERYTHING that can be improved.
